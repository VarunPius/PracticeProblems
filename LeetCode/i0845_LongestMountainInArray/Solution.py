Intuition:
We have already many 2-pass or 3-pass problems, like 821. Shortest Distance to a Character.
They have almost the same idea.
One forward pass and one backward pass.
Maybe another pass to get the final result, or you can merge it in one previous pass.

Explanation:
In this problem, we take one forward pass to count up hill length (to every point).
We take another backward pass to count down hill length (from every point).
Finally a pass to find max(up[i] + down[i] + 1) where up[i] and down[i] should be positives.

Time Complexity:
O(N)

    def longestMountain(self, A):
        up, down = [0] * len(A), [0] * len(A)
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            if A[i] > A[i - 1]: up[i] = up[i - 1] + 1
        for i in range(len(A) - 1)[::-1]:
            if A[i] > A[i + 1]: down[i] = down[i + 1] + 1
        return max([u + d + 1 for u, d in zip(up, down) if u and d] or [0])

Follow up

Can you solve this problem with only one pass?
Can you solve this problem in O(1) space?

In this solution, I count up length and down length.
Both up and down length are clear to 0 when A[i - 1] == A[i] or down > 0 && A[i - 1] < A[i].

    def longestMountain(self, A):
        res = up = down = 0
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            if down and A[i - 1] < A[i] or A[i - 1] == A[i]: up = down = 0
            up += A[i - 1] < A[i]
            down += A[i - 1] > A[i]
            if up and down: res = max(res, up + down + 1)
        return res
