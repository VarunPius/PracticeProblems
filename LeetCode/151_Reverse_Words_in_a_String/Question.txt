 Problem:    Reverse Words in a String
 Difficulty: Medium
 Source:     https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/

/**********************************************************************************
*
* Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
*
* Example 1:
* Input: "the sky is blue"
* Output: "blue is sky the"
*
* Example 2:
* Input: "  hello world!  "
* Output: "world! hello"
* Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
*
* Example 3:
* Input: "a good   example"
* Output: "example good a"
* Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
*
* Note:
* A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
* Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

Note:
Python solution implemented using Deque
Deque used because Note that if you are trying to do that operation often, especially in loops, a list is the wrong data structure.
Lists are not optimized for modifications at the front, and somelist.insert(0, something) is an O(n) operation.
deque is a container class in Python which can hold a collection of python objects.
A deque is a double-ended queue on which elements can be added or removed from either side - that is on left end or right end, head or tail.
A deque is like both a stack and queue.
On a deque, adding an element or removing an element on either side of a deque instance takes constant time O(1).

Add to left:
dq.appendleft()
Remove from left:
dq.popleft()

Add to right:
dq.append()
Remove from right:
dq.pop()
