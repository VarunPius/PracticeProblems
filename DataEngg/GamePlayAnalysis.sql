550. Game Play Analysis IV
Write an SQL query that reports the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:

1097. Game Play Analysis V
Hard
We define the install date of a player to be the first login day of that player.

We also define day 1 retention of some date X to be the number of players whose install date is X and they logged back in on the day right after X, divided by the number of players whose install date is X, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Write an SQL query that reports for each install date, the number of players that installed the game on that day and the day 1 retention.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |

+------------+----------+----------------+
Player 1 and 3 installed the game on 2016-03-01 but only player 1 logged back in on 2016-03-02 so the day 1 retention of 2016-03-01 is 1 / 2 = 0.50
Player 2 installed the game on 2017-06-25 but didn't log back in on 2017-06-26 so the day 1 retention of 2017-06-25 is 0 / 1 = 0.00
